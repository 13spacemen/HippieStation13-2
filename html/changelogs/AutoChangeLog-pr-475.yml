  - rscdel: "Adrenal implants are also removed..."
  - rscadd: "However adrenal implants have been replaced with the Combat Stimulant Implant, instantly heals an amount of most types of damage in addition to curing blindness and deafness as well as giving you a potent cocktail of healing drugs."
  - rscdel: "Stimpacks are also removed"
  - rscadd: "Stimpacks replaced by the syndicate nano booster, basically a shot of 50u syndicate nanites. It's actually incredibly powerful and will make it very tricky for someone to kill you."
  - tweak: "Nicotine no longer reduces stuns but it does slowly give you vitamin making you less hungry."
  - tweak: "Meth no longer makes you run fast and metabolises faster, it also steadily causes a build-up of histamine in your system. If you get stunned it causes a spike of histamine and some extra tox damage."
  - tweak: "Ephedrine no longer reduces stuns and will make you hungry while draining nutriment and vitamin from your system."
  - rscadd: "If you have Meth and Ephedrine in your system they will react violently and you will catch fire that gets more intense the longer it goes on."
  - tweak: "Unholy water no longer reduces stuns, but it's healing has been boosted a bit and will also heal clone, brain and bloodloss damage."
  - tweak: "Bath salts will now fuck you up much more and cause you to drop items as long as it's in your system."
  - tweak: "Crank now deals toxin damage over time, it has the same anti-stunning effect as ephedrine used to. It's addiction threshold is also much lower."
  - tweak: "I bet you powergamers were thinking you could just take some Diphenhydramine and it's be business as usual. Ha, no! I thought of that and the results will be bad for you. For memers it will be wonderful."
